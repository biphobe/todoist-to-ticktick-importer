# Todoist to Ticktick importer

#### Reads the Todoist tasks via API and returns a CSV file for Ticktick's import feature.

If someone will want to use it then:
- add API token from Todoist to `.env`
- `npm install`
- `node app.js`
- import the CSV file @ Ticktick's `Settings > Backup > Import backup`

> :zap: It was just a one-time thing, I'm not really going to develop this any further.
